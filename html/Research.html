        <p>In my PhD research I am working on increasing the amount of cosmological
        information that can be extracted from cosmic shear data. I study the use of higher-order
        mass map statistics sensitive to non-Gaussian information of the mass maps that is complementary
        to the Gaussian information commonly extracted using two-point summary statistics.
        Using a forward-modelling approach I avoid the need to predict higher-order statistics from theory
        for different cosmologies, which often requires to rely on approximations. </p>

            Cosmic shear data contains a large amount of cosmological information
            encapsulated in the non-Gaussian features of the weak lensing mass maps.
            Weak lensing studiesmostly rely on two-point statistics to constrain
            cosmology from cosmic shear data, that do not capture all of this
            information. Additional non-Gaussian information can be extracted
            using non-Gaussian statistics. We compare the constraining power
            in the Ωm–σ8 plane ofthree map-based non-Gaussian statistics with the
            angular power spectrum, namely; peakcounts, minimum counts and
            Minkowski functionals. We further analyze the impact of to-mography
            and systematic effects originating from galaxy intrinsic alignments,
            multiplicativeshear bias and photometric redshift systematics.
            We forecast the performance of the statisticsfor a stage-3-like weak
            lensing survey, spanning an area of 5000 deg2 and restrict ourselves
            to scales ≥ 10 arcmin to avoid baryonic effects.
            The study follows a forward modelling scheme to predict the statistics
            at different cosmologies based on N-Body simulations. We find, that in
            our setup, the considered non-Gaussian statistics provide tighter
            constraints thanthe angular power spectrum. The peak counts show the
            greatest potential, increasing thefigure-of-Merit (FoM) in the
            Ωm–σ8plane by a factor of about 6, while the minimum counts and the
            Minkowski functionals yield an increase by a factor of about 3 and 2,
            respectively. A combined analysis using all non-Gaussian statistics
            in addition to the power spectrum increases the FoM by a factor of 9
            and reduces the error on S<sub>8</sub> by ≈30%. We find that the importance of
            tomography is diminished when combining non-Gaussian statistics with
            the angular power spectrum. The non-Gaussian statistics indeed profit
            less from tomography and the minimum counts and Minkowski functionals
            add some robustness against galaxy intrinsic alignment in a
            non-tomographic setting. We further find that a combination of the
            angular power spectrum and the non-Gaussian statistics allows us to
            apply conservative scale cuts in the analysis, thus helping to
            minimize the impact of baryonic and relativistic effects, while
            conserving the cosmological constraining power. We make the code that
            was used to conduct this analysis publicly available to simplify
            performing such analyses in the future.

            We present evidence for the existence of the splashback radius in galaxy
            clusters selected using the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect, a sample unaffected
            by systematics related to cluster finding in the optical wavelength range.
            We show that the deprojected cross-correlation of galaxy clusters found
            in the Planck survey with galaxies detected photometrically in the Pan-STARRS
            survey shows a sharp steepening feature (a logarithmic slope steeper than−3),
            which we associate with the splashback radius. We infer the 3D splashback radius
            for the SZ cluster sample to be r<sub>sp</sub> =
            1.85<sub>-0.30</sub><sup>+0.26</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> Mpc, where the cluster
            sample has an average halo mass of M<sub>500c</sub> = 3.0 × 10<sup>14</sup>
            h<sup>-1</sup> M<sub>sol</sub> at an average
            redshift of z = 0.18. The inferred value of the splashback radius appears
            marginally consistent with the expected location for dark matter halos in
            the standard cold dark matter paradigm. However, given the limited
            precision of our measurements, we cannot conclusively confirm or rule out the
            smaller splashback radius measured so far in the literature for optically
            selected galaxy clusters. We show that the splashback radius does not depend
            on the galaxy magnitude for galaxies fainter than M<sub>i</sub> - 5 log(h) = -19.44
            and is present at a consistent location ingalaxy populations divided by color.
            The presence of the splashback radius in the star-forming galaxy population
            could potentially be used to put lower limits on the quenching time scales for galaxies.
            We can marginally rule outthe contamination of the star-forming galaxy sample
            by quenched galaxies, but the results would need further verification with deeper data sets.

            For the next generation of spectroscopic galaxy surveys, it is important
            to forecast their performances and to accurately interpret their large data sets.
            For this purpose, it is necessary to consistently simulate different populations
            of galaxies, in particular Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs), less used in the past for
            cosmological purposes. In this work, we further the forward modeling approach
            presented in Fagioli et al. 2018, by extending thespectra simulator Uspec to model
            galaxies of different kinds with improved parameters from Tortorelli et al. 2020.
            Furthermore, we improve the modeling of the selection function byusing the image simulator
            Ufig. We apply this to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and simulate ∼157,000 multi-band images.
            We pre-process and analyse them to apply cuts for target selection, and finally simulate
            SDSS/BOSS DR14 galaxy spectra. We compute photometric, astrometric and spectroscopic properties
            for red and blue, real and simulated galaxies, finding very good agreement.
            We compare the statistical properties of the samples by decomposing them with Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
            We find very good agree-ment for red galaxies and a good, but less pronounced one, for blue galaxies,
            as expected given the known difficulty of simulating those. Finally, we derive stellar
            population properties, mass-to-light ratios, ages and metallicities,
            for all samples, finding again very good agreement. This shows how this method can be used
            not only to forecast cosmology surveys, but it is also able to provide insights into
            studies of galaxy formation and evolution.

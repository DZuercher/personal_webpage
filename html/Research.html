        <p>In my PhD research I am working on increasing the amount of cosmological
        information that can be extracted from cosmic shear data. I study the use of higher-order
        mass map statistics that are sensitive to the non-Gaussian information of mass maps that is complementary
        to the Gaussian information commonly extracted using two-point summary statistics.
        Using a forward-modelling approach I avoid the need to predict higher-order statistics from theory
        for different cosmologies, which often requires to rely on approximations. </p>

            We constrain the matter density Ωm and the amplitude of density fluctuations σ<sub>8</sub>>
            within the ΛCDM cosmological model with shear peak statistics and angular 
            convergence power spectra using mass maps constructed from the first three 
            years of data of the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y3). We use tomographic shear 
            peak statistics, including cross-peaks: peak counts calculated on maps 
            created by taking a harmonic space product of the convergence of two tomographic 
            redshift bins. Our analysis follows a forward-modelling scheme to create a 
            likelihood of these statistics using N-body simulations, using a Gaussian 
            process emulator. We include the following lensing systematics: multiplicative
             shear bias, photometric redshift uncertainty, and galaxy intrinsic alignment. 
             Stringent scale cuts are applied to avoid biases from unmodelled baryonic physics. 
             We find that the additional non-Gaussian information leads to a tightening of 
             the constraints on the structure growth parameter yielding 
             S<sub>8</sub> = 0.797+0.015-0.013 (68% confidence limits), with a 
             precision of 1.8%, an improvement of ~38% compared to the angular power 
             spectra only case. The results obtained with the angular power spectra and 
             peak counts are found to be in agreement with each other and no significant 
             difference in S<sub>8</sub> is recorded. We find a mild tension of 1.5σ between our study 
             and the results from Planck 2018, with our analysis yielding a lower S<sub>8</sub> 
             Furthermore, we observe that the combination of angular power spectra and 
             tomographic peak counts breaks the degeneracy between galaxy intrinsic alignment
              A<sub>IA</sub> and S<sub>8</sub>, improving cosmological constraints. We run a suite of tests concluding 
              that our results are robust and consistent with the results from other studies 
              using DES Y3 data.

            We present cosmological constraints from the analysis of angular 
            power spectra of cosmic shear maps based on data from the first three 
            years of observations by the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y3). Our measurements
             are based on the pseudo-Cl method and offer a view complementary to that 
             of the two-point correlation functions in real space, as the two estimators 
             are known to compress and select Gaussian information in different ways, 
             due to scale cuts. They may also be differently affected by systematic effects 
             and theoretical uncertainties, such as baryons and intrinsic alignments (IA), 
             making this analysis an important cross-check. In the context of ΛCDM, and 
             using the same fiducial model as in the DES Y3 real space analysis, we find 
             S<sub>8</sub>=0.793+0.038-0.025, which further improves to 
             S<sub>8</sub>=0.784±0.026 when including shear ratios. This constraint is within 
             expected statistical fluctuations from the real space analysis, and in 
             agreement with DES~Y3 analyses of non-Gaussian statistics, but favors a 
             slightly higher value of S8, which reduces the tension with the Planck 
             cosmic microwave background 2018 results from 2.3σ in the real space 
             analysis to 1.5σ in this work. We explore less conservative IA models 
             than the one adopted in our fiducial analysis, finding no clear preference 
             for a more complex model. We also include small scales, using an 
             increased Fourier mode cut-off up to kmax=5 h Mpc<sup>-1</sup>, which allows to 
             constrain baryonic feedback while leaving cosmological constraints 
             essentially unchanged. Finally, we present an approximate reconstruction 
             of the linear matter power spectrum at present time, which is found to 
             be about 20% lower than predicted by Planck 2018, as reflected by 
             the 1.5σ lower S<sub>8</sub> value.

            We present high signal-to-noise measurements of three-point shear correlations and 
            the third moment of the mass aperture statistic using the first 3 years of data
             from the Dark Energy Survey. We additionally obtain the first measurements of the 
             configuration and scale dependence of the four three-point shear correlations which 
             carry cosmological information. With the third-order mass aperture statistic, we 
             present tomographic measurements over angular scales of 4 to 60 arcminutes with a
              combined statistical significance of 15.0σ. Using the tomographic information 
              and measuring also the second-order mass aperture, we additionally obtain a 
              skewness parameter and its redshift evolution. We find that the amplitudes 
              and scale-dependence of these shear 3pt functions are in qualitative agreement 
              with measurements in a mock galaxy catalog based on N-body simulations, 
              indicating promise for including them in future cosmological analyses. 
              We validate our measurements by showing that B-modes, parity-violating 
              contributions and PSF modeling uncertainties are negligible, and determine 
              that the measured signals are likely to be of astrophysical and gravitational origin.

            The Cold Spot is a puzzling large-scale feature in the Cosmic Microwave Background
            temperature maps and its origin has been subject to active debate.
            As an important foreground structure at low redshift, the Eridanus supervoid 
            was recently detected, but it was subsequently determined that, assuming the standard 
            ΛCDM model, only about 10-20% of the observed temperature depression can be accounted for 
            via its Integrated Sachs-Wolfe imprint. However, R≳100 h<sup>-1</sup>Mpc supervoids elsewhere in the 
            sky have shown ISW imprints A<sub>ISW</sub>≈5.2±1.6 times stronger than expected from ΛCDM (A<sub>ISW</sub>=1),
             which warrants further inspection. Using the Year-3 redMaGiC catalogue of luminous 
             red galaxies from the Dark Energy Survey, here we confirm the detection of the Eridanus 
             supervoid as a significant under-density in the Cold Spot's direction at z&lt0.2. 
             We also show, with S/N≳5 significance, that the Eridanus supervoid appears as the most 
             prominent large-scale under-density in the dark matter mass maps that we reconstructed 
             from DES Year-3 gravitational lensing data. While we report no significant anomalies, 
             an interesting aspect is that the amplitude of the lensing signal from the Eridanus 
             supervoid at the Cold Spot centre is about 30% lower than expected from similar peaks 
             found in N-body simulations based on the standard ΛCDM model with parameters Ω<sub>m</sub>=0.279 
             and σ<sub>8</sub>=0.82. Overall, our results confirm the causal relation between these 
             individually rare structures in the cosmic web and in the CMB, motivating more 
             detailed future surveys in the Cold Spot region.

            We present a cosmological analysis using the second and third moments of the weak lensing mass (convergence) 
            maps from the first three years of data (Y3) data of the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The survey spans an effective 
            area of 4139 square degrees and uses the images of over 100 million galaxies to reconstruct the convergence field. 
            The second moment of the convergence as a function of smoothing scale contains information similar to standard 
            shear 2-point statistics. The third moment, or the skewness, contains additional non-Gaussian information. 
            The data is analysed in the context of the ΛCDM model, varying 5 cosmological parameters and 19 nuisance parameters 
            modelling astrophysical and measurement systematics. Our modelling of the observables is completely analytical, 
            and has been tested with simulations in our previous methodology study. We obtain a 1.7% measurement of the 
            amplitude of fluctuations parameter S<sub>8</sub>=0.784±0.013. The measurements are shown to be internally 
            consistent across redshift bins, angular scales, and between second and third moments. In particular, the measured 
            third moment is consistent with the expectation of gravitational clustering under the ΛCDM model. 
            The addition of the third moment improves the constraints on S<sub>8</sub> and Ωm by ∼15% and ∼25% compared to an 
            analysis that only uses second moments. We compare our results with Planck constraints from the Cosmic 
            Microwave Background (CMB), finding a 2.2 - 2.8σ tension in the full parameter space, depending on 
            the combination of moments considered. The third moment independently is in 2.8σ tension with Planck, 
            and thus provides a cross-check on analyses of 2-point correlations.

            We present cosmological constraints for the flat ΛCDM model, including the sum of neutrino masses,
            by performing a multi-probe analysis of a total of 13 tomographic auto- and cross-angular power spectra.
            This is achieved by combining, at map level, the latest primary CMB and CMB-lensing measurements from the
            Planck 2018 data release, as well as spectroscopic galaxy samples from BOSS DR12, and the latest
            Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000) tomographic weak lensing shear data release. Our analysis includes 
            auto- and cross-correlations as well as calibration parameters for all cosmological probes, thus 
            providing a self-calibration of the combined data sets. We find a good fit (reduced χ<sup>2</sup>=1.7) for the 
            combined probes with calibration parameters only moderately different from their nominal value, 
            thus giving a possible interpretation of the tension between the early- and late-Universe probes. 
            The resulting value for the structure growth parameter is S<sub>8</sub>=0.754±0.016 (68% CL). We also obtain 
            a ∼2.3σ constrain1t on the neutrino mass sum of ∑m<sub>ν</sub>=0.51+0.21−0.24 eV (68% CL), which is compatible 
            with current particle physics limits. We perform several tests by fixing the neutrino mass sum to 
            a low value, considering narrower priors on the multiplicative bias parameters for cosmic shear, 
            and by fixing all calibration parameters to their expected values. These tests result in worse 
            fits compared to our fiducial run, especially for the case when all calibration parameters are fixed. 
            This latter test also yields a lower upper limit of the neutrino mass sum. We discuss how the 
            interplay between the cosmological and calibration parameters impact the S<sub>8</sub>-tension and the 
            constraints on the neutrino mass sum.

            Cosmic shear data contains a large amount of cosmological information
            encapsulated in the non-Gaussian features of the weak lensing mass maps.
            Weak lensing studiesmostly rely on two-point statistics to constrain
            cosmology from cosmic shear data, that do not capture all of this
            information. Additional non-Gaussian information can be extracted
            using non-Gaussian statistics. We compare the constraining power
            in the Ω<sub>m</sub>–σ<sub>8</sub> plane of three map-based non-Gaussian statistics with the
            angular power spectrum, namely; peakcounts, minimum counts and
            Minkowski functionals. We further analyze the impact of to-mography
            and systematic effects originating from galaxy intrinsic alignments,
            multiplicativeshear bias and photometric redshift systematics.
            We forecast the performance of the statisticsfor a stage-3-like weak
            lensing survey, spanning an area of 5000 deg<sup>2</sup> and restrict ourselves
            to scales ≥ 10 arcmin to avoid baryonic effects.
            The study follows a forward modelling scheme to predict the statistics
            at different cosmologies based on N-Body simulations. We find, that in
            our setup, the considered non-Gaussian statistics provide tighter
            constraints thanthe angular power spectrum. The peak counts show the
            greatest potential, increasing thefigure-of-Merit (FoM) in the
            Ω<sub>m</sub>–σ<sub>8</sub> plane by a factor of about 6, while the minimum counts and the
            Minkowski functionals yield an increase by a factor of about 3 and 2,
            respectively. A combined analysis using all non-Gaussian statistics
            in addition to the power spectrum increases the FoM by a factor of 9
            and reduces the error on S<sub>8</sub> by ≈30%. We find that the importance of
            tomography is diminished when combining non-Gaussian statistics with
            the angular power spectrum. The non-Gaussian statistics indeed profit
            less from tomography and the minimum counts and Minkowski functionals
            add some robustness against galaxy intrinsic alignment in a
            non-tomographic setting. We further find that a combination of the
            angular power spectrum and the non-Gaussian statistics allows us to
            apply conservative scale cuts in the analysis, thus helping to
            minimize the impact of baryonic and relativistic effects, while
            conserving the cosmological constraining power. We make the code that
            was used to conduct this analysis publicly available to simplify
            performing such analyses in the future.

            We present evidence for the existence of the splashback radius in galaxy
            clusters selected using the Sunyaev–Zeldovich effect, a sample unaffected
            by systematics related to cluster finding in the optical wavelength range.
            We show that the deprojected cross-correlation of galaxy clusters found
            in the Planck survey with galaxies detected photometrically in the Pan-STARRS
            survey shows a sharp steepening feature (a logarithmic slope steeper than−3),
            which we associate with the splashback radius. We infer the 3D splashback radius
            for the SZ cluster sample to be r<sub>sp</sub> =
            1.85±0.28 h<sup>-1</sup> Mpc, where the cluster
            sample has an average halo mass of M<sub>500c</sub> = 3.0 × 10<sup>14</sup>
            h<sup>-1</sup> M<sub>sol</sub> at an average
            redshift of z = 0.18. The inferred value of the splashback radius appears
            marginally consistent with the expected location for dark matter halos in
            the standard cold dark matter paradigm. However, given the limited
            precision of our measurements, we cannot conclusively confirm or rule out the
            smaller splashback radius measured so far in the literature for optically
            selected galaxy clusters. We show that the splashback radius does not depend
            on the galaxy magnitude for galaxies fainter than M<sub>i</sub> - 5 log(h) = -19.44
            and is present at a consistent location ingalaxy populations divided by color.
            The presence of the splashback radius in the star-forming galaxy population
            could potentially be used to put lower limits on the quenching time scales for galaxies.
            We can marginally rule outthe contamination of the star-forming galaxy sample
            by quenched galaxies, but the results would need further verification with deeper data sets.

        We present reconstructed convergence maps, mass maps, from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) 
        third year (Y3) weak gravitational lensing data set. The mass maps are weighted projections 
        of the density field (primarily dark matter) in the foreground of the observed galaxies. 
        We use four reconstruction methods, each is a maximum a posteriori estimate with a different 
        model for the prior probability of the map: Kaiser–Squires, null B-mode prior, Gaussian prior, 
        and a sparsity prior. All methods are implemented on the celestial sphere to accommodate 
        the large sky coverage of the DES Y3 data. We compare the methods using realistic ΛCDM 
        simulations with mock data that are closely matched to the DES Y3 data. We quantify the 
        performance of the methods at the map level and then apply the reconstruction methods 
        to the DES Y3 data, performing tests for systematic error effects. The maps are 
        compared with optical foreground cosmic-web structures and are used to evaluate the 
        lensing signal from cosmic-void profiles. The recovered dark matter map covers 
        the largest sky fraction of any galaxy weak lensing map to date.

            For the next generation of spectroscopic galaxy surveys, it is important
            to forecast their performances and to accurately interpret their large data sets.
            For this purpose, it is necessary to consistently simulate different populations
            of galaxies, in particular Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs), less used in the past for
            cosmological purposes. In this work, we further the forward modeling approach
            presented in Fagioli et al. 2018, by extending thespectra simulator Uspec to model
            galaxies of different kinds with improved parameters from Tortorelli et al. 2020.
            Furthermore, we improve the modeling of the selection function byusing the image simulator
            Ufig. We apply this to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and simulate ∼157,000 multi-band images.
            We pre-process and analyse them to apply cuts for target selection, and finally simulate
            SDSS/BOSS DR14 galaxy spectra. We compute photometric, astrometric and spectroscopic properties
            for red and blue, real and simulated galaxies, finding very good agreement.
            We compare the statistical properties of the samples by decomposing them with Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
            We find very good agree-ment for red galaxies and a good, but less pronounced one, for blue galaxies,
            as expected given the known difficulty of simulating those. Finally, we derive stellar
            population properties, mass-to-light ratios, ages and metallicities,
            for all samples, finding again very good agreement. This shows how this method can be used
            not only to forecast cosmology surveys, but it is also able to provide insights into
            studies of galaxy formation and evolution.
